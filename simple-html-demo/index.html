            cypherspace is a place whose entryways and underpinnings lie outside of monolithic server farms, name
            authorities, global singletons, or any other hierarchy dwarfing any of the people who visit or inhabit it.
            its limits are defined solely by the choices of those who work within it, and the consent of those around
            them
